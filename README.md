# Speed_Dating_Analysis
Final Project for Python Course
This project was done using the Speed Dating dataset as compiled at https://data.world/annavmontoya/speed-dating-experiment.
It was done by a classmate and me for an Introductory/Intermediate level crash course in Python programming during the first semester of the second year of my Master's in Dauphine - PSL.

In hindsight, even though my partner insisted back then and yet I paid no attention, we could have created better graphs :)
